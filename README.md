# Flights Dataset and PageRank

In this project, we will look at how to analyze the flights dataset using the PageRank algorithm. The flights dataset consists of three data files, `flights.csv`, `airports.csv` and `airlines.csv`, which are collected by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and are available online at https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays. The `flights.csv` dataset contains the information around 1 million delayed flights in 2015. The `airports.csv` dataset contains the information of 322 airports in the United States. The goal is to analyze which airports are the center for flight delays by calculating the PageRank of each airport.
